#CovAid
 Corona - COVID19 virus affects the respiratory system of healthy individual & Chest X -Ray is one of the important imaging methods to identify the corona virus.  With the Chest X - Ray dataset, Develop a Machine Learning Model to classify the X Rays of Healthy vs Pneumonia (Corona) affected patients & this model powers the AI application to test the Corona Virus in Faster Phase.
 
 #What is CovAid?
 
 •COVID-19 is possibly better diagnosed using radiological
imaging.

• The possibility to detect the COVID-19 disease directly from x-ray images.

•For this reason, machine learning is exploited to build a model
starting from a set of patients COVID-19 diagnosed and patients
with other respiratory diseases exhibiting symptoms similar to
COVID-19

#Objective

•During the recent global urgency, scientists, clinicians, and
healthcare experts around the globe keep on searching for
a new technology to support in tackling the Covid-19
pandemic.

• The evidence of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) application on the previous epidemic
encourage researchers by giving a new angle to fight
against the novel Coronavirus outbreak.

•The COVID-19 recognition system uses AI technology to
detect whether a person has COVID-19 or not . It can be
connected with any medical system installed at your
premise.

•The authorities or admin can check the covid-19 positive
or negative just by uploading the person's lungs X-ray
image to the website and the website will show the result in
no time. The accuracy rate of detecting a person with a
face mask is 90-95% depending on the digital capabilities.
